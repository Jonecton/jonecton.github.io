                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm Jonathan Ecton, a senior at The University of Texas, Rio Grande Valley, pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science, with an expected graduation date of December 2023.</p>
                    <p>My journey has been a unique one. I initially started my computer science journey in 2013 but made the difficult decision to pause my pursuit of a degree just a year later to support my family. During that time, I embarked on a fulfilling career as a boilermaker in the oil refinery industry, where I traveled across the United States, gaining valuable skills in teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving. The fast-paced environment of the industry taught me how to handle high-pressure situations and take accountability for outcomes, both good and bad.</p>
                    <p>Despite the challenges, my passion for technology never waned. It began when I was just 13 years old, when I bought a USB PIC programmer on eBay for $40, and began programming microchips for Xbox 360 controllers. This drive led me to continue my education online at South Texas College while working as a boilermaker.</p>
                    <p>In Fall 2022, I made a bold decision to fully dedicate myself to completing my computer science degree at UTRGV. I quit my job, juggled multiple classes, and thrived in the academic environment. I joined the Frontera Devs software development club at UTRGV and have met many outstanding computer science students and professors during my time on campus.</p>
                    <p>My skills encompass a range of programming languages, technical tools, and core computer science concepts. I have a passion for learning and problem-solving, and I'm constantly expanding my knowledge to stay up-to-date with emerging technologies.</p>
                    <p>My skill set includes proficiency in a variety of programming languages such as C++, C, Python, Java, Haskell, Ruby, Rust, as well as web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm well-versed in technical tools like Linux, MacOS, Android Studio, Git, and databases with SQL. Additionally, I have experience with OpenCV, pyTesseract, and training computer vision models using YoloV8. I'm also familiar with Agile methodology, code integration, continuous deployment, and more.</p>
                    <p>One of my proudest achievements is winning the Best Social Good Project at the Frontera Hacks Hackathon in February 2023. I developed an app called Ally, which connects individuals in need with government assistance and essential resources, addressing issues like utility payments, food access, and transportation to medical appointments.</p>
                    <p>I'm not only dedicated to learning but also enjoy sharing knowledge and collaborating with others. Witnessing my peers excel motivates me to do my best.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. I'm excited to continue my journey in the world of computer science and innovation.</p>

                    <h3>SecureLens - Elementary School Security</h3>
                    <p>SecureLens is an innovative security solution designed for elementary schools. It features automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) software that monitors traffic and reads license plates using OpenCV and EasyOCR. Developed in Python with the Flask framework, SecureLens utilizes SQLite3 to manage the database.</p>
                    <p>The primary function of SecureLens is to enhance the security and efficiency of student pick-up procedures. It accomplishes this by comparing license plates with a database of registered students. When a recognized license plate is detected, it automates the release of students from their classrooms by displaying their names on a classroom screen.</p>
                    <p>SecureLens also provides students with unique ID cards that can be scanned by teachers at the pickup area. After scanning, essential information, including the student's name, parent names, the color, make, and model of the recognized vehicle, and the plate number, is displayed on an Android device, allowing teachers to verify that the individual picking up the child is authorized to do so.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, SecureLens offers a blacklist feature, allowing schools to identify and flag restricted license plates. When a restricted plate is recognized, campus authorities are alerted, enabling them to implement any necessary security measures.</p>
